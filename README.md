# Project 2 Assignment
## Ashley Damrau
### For my Project 2 Assignment, I created a Giphy Search Engine to look up random gifs.
### In my Giphy Search Engine, I created a search box for you to look up specific gifs. Along with a random button to search up any random gifs and a home button to bring you back to the main page.
### Technologies used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
### Ideas for future improvements:
1. Adding categories to search by such as year, popularity, or by a certain creator.
2. Adding profiles to save your gifs.
3. Adding titles, or even dates created to the gifs.
